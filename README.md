# 🛣️ Road Extraction from Satellite Imagery

This project focuses on extracting road networks from high-resolution aerial or satellite images using deep learning, specifically binary semantic segmentation. It is designed for applications such as autonomous navigation, urban planning, and digital cartography.

## 🧠 Model

- Architecture: U-Net (or similar)
- Task: Road vs. background segmentation
- Framework: TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- Output: Binary mask highlighting roads

## 🗂️ Dataset

- Source: Public datasets like DeepGlobe, SpaceNet, or custom-labeled data
- Format: RGB satellite images + binary masks
- Image size: e.g., 256×256

## 📓 Notebook Contents

- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- U-Net model building and training
- Loss and metric visualization
